Project Title: Wireless Animatronic Hand using Arduino Uno

 Abstract: Today Science is intruding in all the sectors ,due to which our lives are becoming more easy.But still there are some places such as Radio active regions in nuclear plant,bomb diffusion , high electric field region etc where the human presence is hazardous but still human has to work in this places.This project is done to check this out,the objective of this project is to prepare a WIRELES ANIMATRONIC HAND which can be used from remote places so the work which requires human presence can be carried out without the presence the human being.

 Software Used: Arduino exe for code execution
 Simulation Platform: Proteus 8
